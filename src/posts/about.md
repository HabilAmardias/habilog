## Introduction

Hi, this is my first article, haha, so it might not be too long or formal. In this article, I'll introduce myself. My name is Muhammad Habil Amardias. I was born on December 9, 2002. I'm a graduate of the Mathematics program at the University of Indonesia. I probably fall into the category of people who like anime, or often called a "weaboo". By the way, my waifu is Elysia from Honkai Impact 3.


## Interest and Journey

I'm interested in machine learning and AI. My interest for AI started unexpectedly during a group project at university. A friend suggested that we incorporate machine learning into our project. At the time, I barely knew what it was, but as I delved deeper, I was amazed by the potential of this technology. What started as a mere suggestion quickly turned into a fascination. I began exploring machine learning more seriously, absorbing as much knowledge as I could from various online resources, like [this cool learning material][d2l] for example, i learned a lot from there! After that, i started joining some machine learning competitions in my country like Satria Data Big Competition and Gammafest. Machine learning and AI field is ever-evolving, and I believe its growth will continue to shape our future in ways we can't yet fully comprehend.

In addition to AI, I've also developed an interest in web development. I'm still very much a beginner, but it's been an exciting learning experience so far. I particularly enjoy using SvelteKit, and in fact, this very blog is built using it!


## About This Blog

Okay, let's stop talking about me, some of you might be wondering about the origin of this blog's name, Habilog. The word Habilog is short for Habil's blog, pretty simple, right? Through this blog, Iâ€™ll be sharing my journey, machine learning and AI projects, or maybe random things that interest me. I hope readers can gain knowledge from this blog or maybe entertained by my content. 

Stay tuned for articles and thank you for reading this article :)
